# Property Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents the initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of property sales data. The primary goal is to understand sales trends, price distributions, and buyer demographics to gain insights into the property market.

This analysis is the foundation for future extensions, including predictive modeling to identify potential buyers and more advanced data-driven decision-making tools. This project marks the beginning of a comprehensive approach to analyzing and forecasting property market behavior.

## Current Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of raw property sales data
- Frequency distribution histograms with a high number of bins and fixed-width bins ($100,000 intervals)
- Scatter plot visualization showing the relationship between property price and area
- Frequency distribution table for buyer countries including absolute, relative, and cumulative frequencies
- Pareto diagram for identifying major buyer countries
- Calculation of key statistical measures: mean, median, mode, skewness, variance, and standard deviation of property prices
